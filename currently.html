                A few days ago Taylor Swift dropped her ninth album Evermore, and it's the only thing I've listened to since. I am IN LOVE. My early favorites
                are No Body No Crime, Gold Rush, Willow, Evermore, and Ivy. And Champagne Problems. And Tis The Damn Season. I love this album so much I can't even
                really rank the songs yet. This just might be my new favorite album.

                Okay, I'm lying a little bit because I technically finished this today. But seriously, if you're looking for a short, deep read with incredible character
                development and a plot that will rip your heart out, then carefully put it back, look no farther than Drowning is Inevitable by Shalanda Stanley.

                I know I'm like over a decade behind, but I'm currently working my way through a Gilmore Girls binge. I was flying through it for a little while,
                but I've slowed down to nearly a stop because of how much I hate Jess. Sorry not sorry.

              <h3>Writing</h3>
              I refer to my WIPs by the name of their leading lady, so right now I am in the process of wrapping up Chelsea. Chelsea is a twenty-two year old
              recent college grad struggling to navigate new adulthood. To help combat her student loan debt and growing list of bills she gets a second job working
               as an assistant to the chaotic organizer of Found, a non-profit after school program. Between the jobs, having fun with her friends, and trying to figure
               out who she is out from the shadow of her impressive siblings, the last thing Chelsea wants is a boyfriend tying her down. She just can't help 
               falling for Lee, the sweet volunteer that she always seems to be bumping into. But can they make it work when everything in her life seems to be working
               against them?
               <br>
               Chelsea's story explores family, both blood and found, friendship, and first real love.
