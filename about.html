            <h2>About me</h2>
            My entire life, as far back as I can remember, I curled up beside my mother before bed and she read to me. 
            <i>The Babysitters' Club. The Magic Treehouse. Junie B. Jones. Main Street. </i> I begged for one more chapter the way
            some kids beg for one more episode. I became fixated on stories, on the idea of lives so very different than my own. A twenty-year 
            age gap with my siblings left me with a lot of time on my own, and I learned that the best way to play by myself was to play
            with stories. Each of my American Girl dolls had a personality, and there was an entire backstory as to how I gained custody of them (because I certainly 
            didn't imagine having that many children on my own.) I created entire plotlines for my dollhouse families that I would carry along with me 
            every time I played. I was eight years old when it first occurred to me to write down the stories swirling in my head. I settled down at my mom's 
            dinosaur desktop, and opened a Word document with a paperclip helper, and I wrote my first book. <br> <br>
            
            It was entitled Meet Jane Flyer, and it was about a girl named ... well, Jane Flyer. It was pretty much entirely exposition, introducing
            our protagonist Jane, her big family full of siblings around her age, her dog, and her friends. There was no plot to speak of, but I felt
             on top of the world when I finished the riveting tale of Jane's daily life (which was about as different from mine as humanly possible). I 
             became addicted to that feeling, and I haven't been able to stop writing since. Stories of vampires and princesses and prison breaks, of falling
             in love with all the wrong people, and sometimes the right ones. Tales of friends and enemies and lovers, of children and teenagers and new adults. I 
             clogged hard drives and filled notebooks with ideas, beginnings of some stories I'd never finish, and some that I did. But when it came time to 
             choose a major and get a job, I chose the logical side of my brain, knowing that I could always make time to write while holding down a stable job
             with a reliable income. <br> <br>

             So I double majored in mathematics and computer science, and minored in psychology. I graduated into a devastating pandemic, fortunate and grateful
             to have secured a job as a software developer, and I worked and I wrote. I hope to publish my debut novel sometime in the next five years, but as 2020 
             has shown, you never know what the future holds.
